# Persian Text Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`test.ipynb`) that performs Persian (Farsi) text classification using deep learning techniques. The notebook includes all steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras and Transformers.

## Features

- Text preprocessing using `hazm`, `parsivar`, `clean-text`, and `emoji`
- Tokenization and embeddings using parsbert
- Deep learning models (CNN and/or LSTM) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation using classification metrics and confusion matrix
